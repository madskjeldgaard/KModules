# KModules

__This project has been abandoned__ in favour of [Sleet](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/sleet)

A synth library including tedious factory functions for creating and managing synths

It takes files containing synth functions and manages them, ie makes SynthDefs and adds them to the system, makes a dictionary for usage with Ctk and a library of functions useful for Ndef filters.

This quark is partly inspired by the way [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) handles this kind of task.

Note, this is strictly made according to my preferences so may not be very
useful for other people but go ahead and try!

Also: it's a work in progress :)

### Installation

In SuperCollider, evaluate the following code to install it as a quark:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/KModules.git");`
