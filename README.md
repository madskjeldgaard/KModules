# KModules

A range of common effects functions, written for NodeProxy role filters

Note, this is strictly made according to my preferences so may not be very
useful for other people but go ahead and try!

Also: it's a work in progress :)

### Installation

In SuperCollider, evaluate the following code to install it as a quark:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/KModules.git");`
